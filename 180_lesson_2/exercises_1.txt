Question #1
------------

SQL is both a special purpose language and a declarative language. It is considered a special purpose language because it is only used for interacting with relational databases, more specifically to manipulate teh structure and values of the datasets stored in relational databases. It is a considered a declarative language because it describes *what* needs to be done but not *how* to accomplish this task, which means that the same query can be executed differently on an identical dataset.
